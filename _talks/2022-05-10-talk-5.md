The purpose of the course were to introduce relational database concepts and help you learn and apply basic knowledge of the SQL language. It is also intended to help you get started with performing SQL access in a data science environment.

The emphasis in this course is on hands-on, hands-on learning. As such, you'll be working with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. You will create a database instance in the cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs, you will practice building and running SQL queries. You will also learn how to access Jupyter notebook databases using SQL and Python.
