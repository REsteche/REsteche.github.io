Hello there! Welcome to my personal academic site. My name is Ruben Esteche, I’m a physicist working on data science and natural language processing. I have a particular interest in the application of statistical data analysis to uncover linguistics patterns permeating large language models. I'm currently working at [NTT Data](https://br.nttdata.com/) in a project that uses several NLP techniques linked to LLM's in a transformers architecture to compose a chatbot creation platform for companies around the world.


I hold both a bachelor’s (2021) and a master’s degree (2023) in Physics from the State University of Pernambuco, where I have researched temporal aspects of QM, from a new arrival time distribution to tunneling time numerical modeling. I also have experience in causality relationships of events in quantum mechanics and a good understanding of data science and machine learning tools. I am also a postgraduate in computer science (2023), with specialization in data science.


I’m always looking to collaborate with other researchers and expand my network and knowledge, if you are interested in discussing any of my research topics, you can contact me anytime. As I like to post some personal projects in an educational blog format, you should feel free to [check them here](https://resteche.github.io/REsteche_blog/); And for a deeper dive, you can explore a little more of my work on [my github!](https://github.com/REsteche).
