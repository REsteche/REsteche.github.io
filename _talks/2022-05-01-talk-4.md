South American Institute for Fundamental Research course with theoretical and practical foundations in the field of data science with modules on machine learning and graphical display. Below, I leave transcribed the call of the main page of the course

Contemporary research – particularly when addressing the most significant, transdisciplinary research challenges – cannot be done effectively without a range of skills relating to data. This includes the principles and practice of Open Science and research data management and curation, the use of a range of data platforms and infrastructures, large scale analysis, statistics, visualization and modeling techniques, software development and annotation and more. We define ‘Research Data Science’ as the ensemble of these skills.

The School on Research Data Science have a focus on growing competence in accessing, analyzing, visualizing, and publishing data. It is open to participants from all disciplines and/or backgrounds from the sciences to humanities. This activity will cover topics on principles and practice of Open Science, research data management and curation, use of a range of research compute infrastructures, large scale analysis, statistics, visualization and modeling techniques, automation and scripting.
