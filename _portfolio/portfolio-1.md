In this undergrad project we revisited Euler’s studies of elastic in an attempt to analytically describe the curvature relationships between a two immiscible fluid system with different boundary conditions and viscosity. By the end of the project, turns out that we have to conduct some numerical simulations to solve non linear ODE's of our system. We also conducted experiments in this system and the project was a great opportunity to learn about the experimental routine in laboratory.
