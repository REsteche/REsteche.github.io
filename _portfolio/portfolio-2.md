From the construction made by DIAS, E. O.; PARISIO, F. Space-time-symmetric extension of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. Physical
Review A, APS, v. 95, no. 3, p. 032133, 2017, we develop a new space-conditional solution in the scope of this theory
for a particle under initial time-dependant conditions. At the moment, we have already constructed the whole model and we were able 
to efficiently compare with models of absorbtive potentials and temporal distributions idealized by the probability current. A publication 
about this project is being written, and more details regarding numerical modeling of this work can be found in 
[this repository](https://github.com/REsteche/master_works/tree/master/programas) .
