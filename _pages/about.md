Welcome to my personal academic site. My name is Ruben Esteche, I'm a bachelor in physics and currently doing a M.Sc in foundations of quantum mechanics at Federal University of Pernambuco - Brazil, and working as a machine learning developer at [DELL Lead](https://leadfortaleza.com.br/portal). I’m currently researching on temporal aspects of QM, from a new arrival time distribution to tunneling time numerical modeling. I also have experience in causality relationships of events in quantum mechanics and a good understanding of data science and machine learning tools. 

I’m always looking to collaborate with other researchers and expand my network and knowledge, if you are interested in discussing any of my research topics, you can contact me anytime. I'm currently dedicated in conducting my master's research, and in my part-time job at a DELL research and development institute. I like to post some personal projects in an educational blog format, you should [check them out!](https://resteche.github.io/REsteche_blog/); And for a deeper dive, feel free to explore a little more of my work on [my github!](https://github.com/REsteche)
